# RetroArch - Delta GBA Overlay for iPhone
This is a RetroArch overlay to use for GBA games on iOS. The overlay is heavily inspired by Delta Emulator overlay. I've created the overlay to use on iPhone 13 Pro Max screen - any devices with different screen sizes may not scale perfectly. I do not have any other devices to test on unfortunately.

# Installation
The easiest way to install this on iOS is to download the repository as a `.zip` archive. In Files app, extract the archive and move `gba_delta` directory somewhere inside the RetroArch directory on your iPhone. I moved it to: `RetroArch/overlays/gamepads/`.

In RetroArch settings: **User Interface** > **On-Screen Overlay**  > **Overlay Preset**.  Navigate to where you moved `delta_gba` and select `retro-arch-gba-overlay_w_savestate.cfg`
